This tutorial is stupid, and I still don't know how to use the git. By the way, I believe OS is more difficult than compiler, but I think there will be much more fun of OS than a compiler.

Day 1, I studied how to use git. To be honest, I don't think this is good for individual user but for group. I hope I can master git as soon as possible.
